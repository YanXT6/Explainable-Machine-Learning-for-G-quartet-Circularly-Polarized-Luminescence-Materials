Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials attract significant attention due to unique chiral optical properties and broad applications. However, their rational design of such materials remains challenging. To overcome this, we establish a machine learning (ML)-driven platform that enables intelligent screening of deep eutectic solvents (DES) for developing G-quartet-based gels with tailored CPL. By training a ML classifier on experimental data, we achieved an accuracy of 0.914 in predicting CPL activity, while SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis further identifies key DES molecular descriptors that critically influences CPL performance. Notably, external validation discovers novel DES-G-quartet materials exhibiting exceptional CPL, with a maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor (gₗᵤₘ) reaches 0.222, surpassing previous records of nucleotide-based biomaterial. Remarkably, chirality inversion (generating mirror-image CPL signals) is achieved solely by modulating DES combinations. Furthermore, the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) symbolic regression algorithm derives interpretable molecular descriptor formulas to guide material design. Owing to the distinct circular polarization dependence exhibited by chiral gels, we developed a fourth-level anti-counterfeiting strategy and validated its feasibility. The concealed information was successfully decrypted using Morse and ASCII codes, demonstrating that this multi-level encryption approach significantly enhances the security of information storage. Overall, this ML-driven methodology not only accelerates the discovery of high-performance CPL materials but also paves the way for new design avenues.
